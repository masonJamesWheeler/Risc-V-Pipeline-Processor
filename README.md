## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of the RISC-V Pipeline Processor project, an exemplary demonstration of cutting-edge embedded systems engineering and modern computer architecture understanding. The processor has been carefully designed to implement the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, utilizing a pipelined architecture for enhanced throughput and performance efficiency.

This project showcases a deep understanding of hardware design, computer architecture, pipelining, and software-hardware interface, ideal for applications requiring a highly efficient, scalable, and modular processing core.

## Directory Structure

The project has a simple and clear directory structure for easy navigation:

```
.
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── <source files>
├── test.sh
└── testbench
    └── <test bench files>
```

- `Makefile`: Contains the build commands for the project.
- `src`: This directory contains all the source files for the pipeline processor.
- `test.sh`: A shell script to run the test bench.
- `testbench`: This directory contains all test bench files used for testing and validation of the pipeline processor.

## Installation

To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone <repository_link>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd <directory_name>
```
3. Use the make command to compile the source files.
```bash
make
```

## Usage

To run the RISC-V Pipeline Processor:

1. Make sure you have successfully compiled the project as mentioned in the installation steps.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
./pipeline
```

## Testing

The project includes an extensive suite of test benches to validate the correct operation of the pipeline processor.

To execute the test bench, simply run the provided shell script in your terminal:

```bash
./test.sh
```

This script will run all the tests and output the results in the terminal. The tests provide a robust assessment of the pipeline's performance and correctness, ensuring the system's reliability and accuracy.
